Main Folder --- Java non test case files
TestsFiles Folder --- main test cases
-------Main Folder------
1. Include all required URLS in APIConstants_Common
2. Prepare a PayloadManager class file for including body request things for serialization
   and deserialization of POST,GET,PATCH, PUT or delete which ever is required
3. Create getters and setters for getting required strings from requests using POJO classes by
   using jsonchematopojo website for various http methods which ever is required, if you require any
   filed from response then create pojo for it too
--------Tests Folder----
4. Create Base Test file which generally includes main URL Part test which is common or first step
5. Create Assertions file which will include all assertions of required tests
6. Under Resource folder include files which are required for testing
7. Under Tests folder create main tests individually and as well integration
   create a sample folder too which will have templates for basic testing


Steps:----
1. Run the base path from the variable of main url mentioned in base test as base path is diff
for each http methods
2. Now give the body parameters from payload manager by creating a variable to hold its value
and the post method is applied
3. Now get the response by creating a variable to hold the value to check the status code whether
it has been created
4. Now to validate the response call the payload manager deserialization to convert the json
into java object for this the base test should be used as we have created its instance in it
5.Testcase file calls --> basetest calls--> payloadmanager calls --> pojo class for response
6. now use a instance of class to hold its value of response field which is to be validated
